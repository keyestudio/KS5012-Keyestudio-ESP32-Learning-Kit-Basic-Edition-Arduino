## 1.Download and install Arduino software：

（1）First, enter arduino's official website:
[<span class="underline">https://www.arduino.cc/</span>](https://www.arduino.cc/)
, and click “SOFTWARE”to enter the download page. As shown in the figure
below：

![](/media/7250961db41ba42e4b881d77bd76a319.png)

(2) Then, select and download the corresponding installer for your
operating system. If you are a Windows user, please select “Windows
Installer” to download to install the driver correctly.

Choose to click the **Windows Win7 and newer** to download Arduino
1.8.16 version installer, which requires manual installation. But when
click the **Windows ZIP File**, the Arduino 1.8.16 zip file will be
downloaded directly, just unzip it to complete the installation.

In general, you can click **JUST DOWNLOAD** to download it.

(3) After the Arduino IDE is downloaded, continue the installation. When
you receive the warning from the operating system, please allow the
driver installation by clicking **I Agree** first, and then click
**Next** after selecting the components to install.

（4）Select the installation directory (we recommend keeping the default
directory), and then click **Install**.

![](/media/7da9aca1e8432c59372e7c7ab2574bd9.png)

（5）Select Install if the following screen appears.

This process extracts and installs all the necessary files to properly
execute the Arduino software (IDE).

After installation is complete, an Arduino Software shortcut will be
generated in the desktop.

## 2.Install a driver on Windows：

（Note：If you have installed the driver, just skip it）

Before using the ESP32 board, you must install a driver, otherwise it
can not communicate with the computer. Unlike the USB series chip
(ATMEGA8U2) of the Arduino UNO R3, the ESP32 board is used the CP2102
chip USB series chip and USB type C interface.

The driver of the CP2102 chip is included in 1.8.0 version and newer
version of Arduino IDE. Usually, you connect the board to the computer
and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process. After a
few moments, the process will succeed.

**Note:**

1\. Please make sure that your IDE is updated to 1.8.0 or newer version

2\. If the version of Arduino IDE you download is below 1.8, you should
download the driver of CP2102 and install it manually.

Link to download the driver of CP2102:

[**<span class="underline">https://fs.keyestudio.com/CP2102-WIN</span>**](https://fs.keyestudio.com/CP2102-WIN)

If the driver installation process fail, you need to install the driver
manually. Open device Manager for your computer and right-click“the
computer”→click“Properties”→Click“Device Manager”. Look under Ports (COM
& LPT) or other device, a yellow exclamation mark means that the CP2102
driver installation failed.

![](/media/9af2e34bf9bdd6675bdf5fa8cd291971.png)

It shows that the driver for CP2102 fails to be installed successfully
if there is a yellow mark. Double-click![](/media/a2455b26773cb8d6cb3fccc605ea4dd7.png), and then
click “**Update drive...**” to update the driver.

![](/media/a122cd6fef74eb5c0c7fe16fac2fed59.png)

Click “**Browse my computer for drivers**”to find the Arduino software
we installed or downloaded.

![](/media/a02d3e643231cfe267d4debf0ef258c4.png)

There is a **drivers** folder in Arduino software installed
package（![](/media/aae89b3213589edf1c320d5502489820.png)）, open the driver folder and you can
see the driver of CP210X series chips.

Click“**Browse...**”, then find the drivers folder, or you could
enter“driver”to search in rectangular box, then click“**Next**”,

![](/media/eb6ca318005b5c570ad4fbef73024351.png)

After a while, the driver is installed successfully.

![](/media/4f2af46602a5ef73985914170911c519.png)

Open the computer device Manager again, you can see that the CP2102
driver has been successfully installed, and find the yellow exclamation
mark disappear.

## 3\. Install the ESP32 on Arduino IDE：

The installation process for ESP32 is almost the same as that for
ESP8266. If you are to install ESP32 on an Arduino IDE, follow these
steps：

Note：you need to download Arduino IDE 1.8.5 or advanced version to
install the ESP32.

1)   Click the icon![](/media/4f2de68a91c7f59024aa87a522e36ab3.png)to open the Arduino IDE。
    
    ![](/media/8aca9b5378e794375f2c15d3b4e238ba.png)
    
    （2）Click“**File**” →**“Preferences”**，copy the website address
    ：<https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json> in
    the“**Additional Boards Manager URLs:**”，and then click“**OK**” to
    save the address.

![](/media/ea68c66041f48b44b4682eb3a0e11e79.png)

（3）First click “**Tools**”→“**Board:**”，and click“**Boards
Manager...**”to enter“**Boards Manager**”, enter“**ESP32**”in the box
after“**ALL**”, then select the latest version to install, the
installation package is not large, click“**Install**”to Install the
plug-in, as shown in the figure below.

4.  After successful installation, click“**Close**”to Close the page。

## 4\. Arduino IDE Setting:

（1）Click the icon![](/media/4f2de68a91c7f59024aa87a522e36ab3.png) to open the Arduino IDE.

![](/media/8aca9b5378e794375f2c15d3b4e238ba.png)

（2）When downloading the code to the board, you must select the correct
name of Arduino board that matches the board connected to your computer,
then click“**Tools**”→“**Board:**”. As shown below ;

(Note: we use the ESP32 board in this tutorial; therefore, we select
ESP32 Arduino**)**

![](/media/3a3bbc0ce1845aceb35af40aea7c84ca.png)

Set the board type as follows:

![](/media/43b6c4d7f639f1e4b7adb017db805ea1.png)

Then select the correct COM port (the corresponding COM port can be seen
after the driver is installed successfully).

![](/media/97ab2e53b87bd0812b2b064405f86196.png)

Before a code was uploaded to the ESP32 mainboard, we have to
demonstrate the functionality of each symbol that appeared in the
Arduino IDE toolbar.

![](/media/1235ef274c17d00db74fca324072ff84.png)

A- Used to verify whether there is any compiling mistakes or not.

B- Used to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

C- Used to create shortcut window of a new sketch.

D- Used to directly open an example sketch.

E- Used to save the sketch.

F- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial
monitor.
